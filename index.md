<div class="lead font-sans-xl measure-4 text-light">Inspired by Lauren Bon’s text-based neon work on view in the courtyard—from which it borrows its title—this exhibition, together with its accompanying public programming 1001 Stories for Survival, addresses the environmental crisis in the age of climate change, with a focus on the Mediterranean Sea.</div>



The show brings together 73 artists of different generations and cultural backgrounds whose selected works, in a wide range of media, invite critical awareness on the fragility of nature and human life while poetically invoking the regeneration of living systems. On view here are works by Wolfgang Laib, Lauren Bon, Shoja Azari & Shahram Karimi, Julian Charrière, and Shirin Neshat that meditate on themes such as ephemerality, transformation, and interconnectedness.

During the course of the exhibition in a dedicated space (Sala delle Colonne, whose entrance is just next to the Church), the New York-based _Brooklyn Rail_ journal—a radical and free publication—re-creates its “social environment” in Venice. On view in that space—where some of the Brooklyn Rail staff is present—are works by Phong Bui, Justin Brice Guariglia and Newton Harrison, as well as _The Wall of Offering: To Venice With Love_, an altar-like installation of paintings, drawings, photographs, and sculptures by a wide range of established and emerging artists. In the courtyard, together with Bon’s neon work, are an installation by Maya Lin and a work by Rirkrit Tiravanija & Tomas Vu that is activated during their performances with Sarah Sze (on May 8 and November 24).
