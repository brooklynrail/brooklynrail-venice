<p><a href="https://brooklynrail.org">The Brooklyn Rail</a>, an independent arts publication based in New York city, was invited to exhibit at the <a href="#">2019 Venice Biennale</a>. Our engagement consists of an <a href="#">exhibition</a> of the work of <a href="#">74 artists</a> at the Chiesa di Santa Maria delle Penitenti curated by <a href="#">Phong Bui and Lauren Bon</a>, our “<a href="#">social environment</a>” recreated in the Sala delle Colonne next to the church, and a series of <a href="#">events</a> around both the exhibition and the environment.</p></div>
