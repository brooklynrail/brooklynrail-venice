The show brings together 73 artists of different generations and cultural backgrounds whose selected works, in a wide range of media, invite critical awareness on the fragility of nature and human life while poetically invoking the regeneration of living systems. On view here are works by Wolfgang Laib, Lauren Bon, Shoja Azari & Shahram Karimi, Julian Charrière, and Shirin Neshat that meditate on themes such as ephemerality, transformation, and interconnectedness.
