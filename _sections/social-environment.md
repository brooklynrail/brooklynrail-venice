Present with its staff during the course of the exhibition in this dedicated space, the _Brooklyn Rail_ journal—a radical and free publication based in New York City—recreates its “social environment” in Venice where it will produce its monthly issues as well as an issue of the _River Rail_, a publication documenting our exhibition and its interdisciplinary public program bringing together artists, scientists, scholars, poets, writers, and musicians. Presented here are works by Phong Bui, Justin Brice Guariglia, and Newton Harrison, as well as _The Wall of Offering: To Venice With Love_, an altar-like installation of paintings, drawings, photographs, and sculptures by a wide range of established and emerging artists. In the courtyard are a neon work by Lauren Bon, from which the exhibition takes its inspiration, an installation by Maya Lin and a work by Rirkrit Tiravanija & Tomas Vu. The latter is a multi-functional ping-pong/cooking table activated during their performances with Sarah Sze (on May 8 and November 24).
