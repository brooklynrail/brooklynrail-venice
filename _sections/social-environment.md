_“Art as a Social Activity”_

Present with its staff during the course of the exhibition, the _Brooklyn Rail_—a radical and free publication based in New York City—recreates its _Social Environment_ in Venice. The inspiration for our _Social Environment_ comes from an understanding of our work as a creative act, which produces the monthly journal, public forums, and informal gatherings that are a platform for the diverse voices of our community. In Venice, we will produce our monthly issues in addition to a special issue of the _River Rail_, a publication documenting our exhibition and its interdisciplinary public programming bringing together artists, scientists, scholars, poets, writers, and musicians focusing on environment and climate change.
