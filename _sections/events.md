For June's full moon, we will host a deep listening session of Lauren Bon’s Oratorio Mare Nostrum, a site responsive, three channel durational sound installation for Chiesa di Santa Maria delle Penitenti. On June 17, we will activate what the artist intends as the fourth channel of the sound installation; the fourth channel being the ambient in her work. All are invited to listen and engage in this sonic experience.<br/><br/>During the Oratorio Mare Nostrum events, guests are encouraged to join us at our local eco restaurant/cultural venue partner Laguna Libre, where a complimentary beverage will be offered to visitors attending the event.
